 RefTerm implements a high-performance Windows terminal emulator through a layered architecture of well-defined interfaces. The
   codebase demonstrates exceptional engineering with clear separation of concerns, minimal dependencies, and intelligent
  performance optimizations.

  Core Interfaces

  1. [Glyph Cache Interface](./glyph-cache.md)

  Purpose: LRU cache for GPU glyph textures
  - 128-bit AES hashing for strong glyph identification
  - Doubly-linked LRU with sentinel node design
  - Power-of-2 hash tables for fast modulo operations
  - Single-allocation memory layout with SSE alignment
  - Cache hit/miss/recycle statistics tracking

  2. [D3D11 Renderer Interface](./d3d11-renderer.md)

  Purpose: Hardware-accelerated terminal rendering
  - Dual pipeline support: Traditional rasterization and compute shaders
  - Fullscreen quad generation without vertex buffers
  - Structured buffer for terminal cells (12 bytes/cell)
  - 2048x2048 glyph atlas texture
  - 8x8 compute thread groups for optimal GPU occupancy

  3. [Terminal Buffer Interface](./terminal-buffer.md)

  Purpose: Terminal state and text processing
  - Circular buffer design for efficient scrolling
  - SIMD-optimized UTF-8 scanning (16-byte blocks)
  - Uniscribe integration for complex scripts (with acknowledged limitations)
  - VT100/ANSI escape sequence support
  - 24-bit RGB colors with attribute flags in high bits

  4. [Glyph Generator Interface](./glyph-generator.md)

  Purpose: Font rasterization via DirectWrite
  - C wrapper hiding DirectWrite C++ complexity
  - Performance bottleneck: "two orders of magnitude" slower than needed
  - Draw-then-transfer pattern for GPU updates
  - Tile-based scaling for oversized glyphs

  5. [Fast Pipe Interface](./fast-pipe.md)

  Purpose: Windows console bypass for 550x performance gain
  - Named pipe mechanism using process ID
  - Bypasses conhost.exe intermediary
  - 16MB pipe buffers for high throughput
  - Graceful fallback to standard handles
  - 10x performance improvement over conhost path

  Architecture Relationships

  Input Stream → Fast Pipe → Terminal Buffer → Glyph Cache → D3D11 Renderer
                     ↓             ↓              ↑              ↓
                Source Buffer   Uniscribe    DirectWrite    GPU Shaders
                              (Complex Text)  (Rasterizer)

  Key Performance Characteristics

  1. Glyph caching eliminates redundant rasterization - Critical given DirectWrite's slowness
  2. SIMD operations throughout - SSE for hashing, text scanning, and memory operations
  3. Minimal allocations - Single-block memory layouts, circular buffers
  4. GPU efficiency - Batched updates, structured buffers, compute shaders
  5. I/O optimization - Fast pipes provide 10x throughput improvement

  Design Philosophy

  The interfaces demonstrate Casey Muratori's "straightforward code" philosophy:
  - No unnecessary abstraction - Direct API usage where appropriate
  - Performance-aware design - Acknowledges and works around Windows API limitations
  - Clear ownership - Each interface has specific responsibilities
  - Minimal dependencies - Interfaces are loosely coupled
  - Pragmatic engineering - Ships working code despite platform limitations

  The codebase serves as an excellent example of how to build a high-performance terminal emulator on Windows, achieving
  performance that "embarrasses" commercial terminals while maintaining clean architecture and reasonable code complexity
